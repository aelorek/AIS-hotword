# AIS-hotword
This is our test application for wake word detection, that works on Android devices.

The goal is to create a highly-accurate and lightweight wake word (a.k.a. keyword spotting, trigger word detection, hotword detection, and voice command) engine.
Then enables it into always-listening voice-enabled AI-Speaker.com devices.
